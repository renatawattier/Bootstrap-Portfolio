                        I would like to start by saying I picked this photo for my profile because this is how I felt completing this homework. I
                        just don't quite get what I am doing, and it was incredibly frustraing trying to complete this assigment.
                        In case you are wondering, when I asked my husband to take this photo I asked him if it looked like I was
                        holding the Louvre. Obviously, he missed by a tinny bit and this how I am turning in this assigment.

                        My Name is Renata Wattier and I was born and raised in Brazil. I moved to United States in 2000 to attend Union College in
                        Lincoln, NE. In 2005 I started working at State Farm in Lincoln, NE, and because of my job with State Farm
                        I moved to Arizona in 2013. I am married to Jeff but you can call him Jeffy Pooh. I enjoy playing and watching
                        sports, I used to play Roller Derby when I lived in Nebraska and had the opportunity to travel all over the
                        country because of Roller Derby. If you have never attend a Roller Derby Bout and you enjoy watching full
                        contact sports, you should give Roller Derby a try.

                        Jeff and I enjoy traveling and we go to one big overseas trip every year, we just came back from Brazil the Saturday before
                        the boot camp started and we are planning a trip to Greece next year. We are also planning a trip to Germany
                        during Oktoberfest in a couple of years. I am not quite sure what is more difficult, trying to find things
                        to write about myself or compleing the assigment. If you are curious to learn a little more about me just
                        ask!
